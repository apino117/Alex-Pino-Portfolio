                <p> Hi there! My name is Alex, I’m an artist. I grew up in the suburbs of DC, childhood on the
                    Maryland
                    side, teenage years in Virginia. My area in Maryland was heavily wooded so from an early age
                    I found
                    myself in love with nature and with connecting to the earth. As I got older I realized I was
                    channeling that same love into my art, I’ve always had a hand for the visual arts but my
                    real
                    affinity lies with music. To quote Albus Dumbledore music is “a magic beyond all we do here”
                    and
                    although the “here” to which he was referring is the magical school Hogwarts I believe we
                    can apply
                    it to our existence as humans. What I mean when I say that is that music has ways of
                    affecting us
                    that we don’t even fully comprehend, ways we don’t even notice. If you’ve ever had someone
                    point out
                    a particular chord change or flourish and note the emotional attachment you may be familiar
                    with the
                    “ah-ha” moment of putting words to a feeling you’ve never realized you were experiencing.
                </p>
                <p>The reason I mention music is that it’s a very convenient metaphor for the framework with
                    which I
                    view life and communication. Just like a minor chord elicits a sad emotion there are
                    variables in
                    our day-to-day lives of which we may not be explicitly aware but which have a profound affect
                    on our
                    perception and therefore our emotions. My goal therefore as a developer is to bring an
                    artistic and
                    philosophical ethos into the context of web design and creation. In design every detail from
                    the
                    small to the large has a crucial role to play when manipulating the effect your product will
                    have.
                    Ultimately this applies to everything in life, from the color of stop signs to the width of
                    a
                    sidewalk; every single detail is relevant and chains together. When you hire me as a
                    developer
                    you’re getting someone who thinks beyond the surface level, deeper than what’s necessary;
                    what’s
                    affective. There is no opportunity too small for an artistic approach and there is no
                    product
                    without room for analysis. My ongoing work is to continue to note analyze and implement
                    artistic
                    values in every aspect of my life because ultimately I believe this will lead to a better
                    quality of
                    life not only for myself but for the whole world.
