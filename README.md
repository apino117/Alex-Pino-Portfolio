# Alex's Portfolio

Hi there, and welcome to my portfolio page! I'm Alex!

My profile is for anyone who wants to contact me, learn about me or check out my work.

The goal of this is to get myself out into the world and make new connections to see where my coding career takes me.

Some of my content is for adults only, my humor is a little mature at times but for the most part everything is rated PG-13 or lower

To start just go on and have a look around!

If you need any assistance or have any questions please fill out a comment on the contact page and hopefully I'll figure out what to do with that!

Thanks!
